    "Description":"A futher speed optimised configuration - This one includes the DH-80-4200 engine with a special transmission box that spins the rotors 10% faster with an aerodynamically refined tail stabiliser. But be careful because you have limited oil and without oil you cannot cool your engine down. Be warned with the extra rotor speed comes extra inertia, therefore much more catastrophic - You may not be able to autorotate to safety.",
