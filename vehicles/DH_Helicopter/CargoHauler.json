    "Description":"This experimental heavy duty hauling military grade helicopter was fitted with short time limited overboost up to 2.5 Bar manifold pressure, guaranteeing in excess of 95hp for two minutes and a half. It comes with a highly manouvrable and durable rigid rotor for situations in which it needs to defend itself.
    The helicopter comes with a specialised turbocharger using experimental secretive manufacturing techniques and seals which extracts a little more power, but is more prone to overheating.
    
    Running full power in excess of 1.5 minutes is prohibited.",
