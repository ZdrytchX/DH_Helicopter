    "Description":"When a certain third world military ran out of DH65 supply and quad-blade rotors, they resorted to repurposing HR-Twinblades with DH50 engines, reinforcing few criticial components and tuned it to operate with a military grade turbocharger, with a step-up gearbox boosting the rotors to a dangerously high 4500 RPM. The doctorine was in that using surplus lower revving DH50 engine allows for a more responsive power delivery with the military grade turbocharger.
    Unfortunately the engine improvements only allows 110hp for 5 minutes, but can run under full load in excess of 2.2 Bar generating in excess of 140hp in emergencies for about a minute and a half.
    
    Continuous flight mode at 1.6 Bar / 23 psi producing 94hp",
