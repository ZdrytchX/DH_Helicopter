# DH Super Gnat
 A fork of Darren9's DH Super Gnat

INSTALLATION: Don't extract the files, leave them in the zip. Move the zip to your BeamNG's mod folder (e.g. `BeamNG.drive\0.33\mods` at this time)

Hi, ZdrytchX here.

This is an unofficial mod release. The original creator, Darren9 has now given me permission, even to release on repo, but I likely won't until this mod is more stable, and I would also like to implement the remaining unused assets and solve a bunch of jbeam related issues.

## Troubleshooting

Just note that due to the part heiarchy changes, this mod is not mix-mod compatible with Darren's original version of the super gnat. You should only use one or the other, many people have reported issues regarding this in the past.
You can tell if you have previously installed darren's original version of the mod improperly when installing this mod because the vehicle icon may still have the orange "BETA" tag, and when you load your helicopter in, it may not have an engine or something stupid.

If this is the case, you should go to your `BeamNG.drive\0.33\vehicles\DH_helicopter` folder, and delete everything EXCEPT your `.pc` (part config) and `.jpeg` (screenshot) files. The `.pc` files are your pre-made configs, they should still be compatible with this mod regardless of the changes done. You should not have any `.jbeam` files in your `0.33\vehicles` folder, if you do then you likely have installed a mod incorrectly. Mods should NOT be unzipped, except for BeamLR (of which should have its own dedicated user folder as it *literally breaks everything else* in BeamNG)

Disclaimer: There's a lot of unfinished jank left in this mod. If you have an issue anyway, let me know on discord https://discord.gg/mzk22m9dcy
