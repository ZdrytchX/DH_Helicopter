Hi, ZdrytchX here.

This is an unofficial mod release. The original creator, Darren9 has __not__ formally given me permission.

I looked into the history of why this strangely enough quality mod isn't on the repo - apparently it was. Rumours were that he had an arguement with a dev and requested his account (and thus all his mods) to be taken down. As a result, this mod is technically "illegal" to be hosted on the forums but I loved it so much that here I am, releasing a mod of his mod albeit unofficially through other means.

I actually don't know how to contact him because his legacy is just that old so if anyone has his details, forward it to me please.

If anyone has the full story, let me know:
